Gathering Assets

Find a series which has not been done - use mf to see if the cards already exist.
Show trello as a demonstration of how to find a series to do.

Find images for each character.
Justify a suitable image:
- Preferrably transparent (show google images color > transparent tools)
- Relatively High resolution, for level 1s full body images are preferred, but will be slightly cropped once placed on the card.
(NOTE: Sometimes, better images can be found using google's reverse image search and visually similar images.)
